        <div style="background-color: rgb(197, 193, 139); width: 750px;"><p style= width:750px; >Ion is currently on Module 3 (Mk3) after his creator took extra time to study his adoptive brother's abilities, he was able to gain a bit of an understanding on how it works. Due to him not being a Astroin, he's unable to use it, but while creating Ion, he had to get a blood sample for the Eptic bot which can work for said abilities if blood is present outside of said person's body. giving Ion his reinforced armor, and has larger openings so he can rightfully and effectively cool down, which was an issue for other eptics, Mk3 uses samples of lava to help Ion heat up in warmer climates and can be use as a backup energy soruce and with this model and model 2, his forearms changed from being a model of a standard human's forearm, to a multi-use cannon, letting him shoot out energy blasts powered by the blood/DNA from said Astroin </p></div>
        <div style="background-color: rgb(197, 193, 139); width: 750px;"><p style= width:750px; >Ion's Mk2 Model was given a stronger senor compared to his first design, Mk2 has also gave him his new forearm designs, in this model it was limited due to the overheating issue that other Eptics has faced. </p></div>
        <div style="background-color: rgb(197, 193, 139); width: 750px;"><p style= width:750px; >Mk1 or his initial design was modeled on humans, following with the otehr eptics, their bodies had smaller frames, to move with less risk of being destroyed in battle, their biggest issue was their need of constant cooling, Model 1 wasa very much bound to stop operating from heating up and not having many openings on their bodies to cool down</p></div>

         <div style="background-color: rgb(197, 193, 139); width: 750px;"><p>Ion's creator Sickle, was a very smart and was a very adaptive and fast learner who liked to program and creating robots. After some time, due to not being a pureblood Astroin, he's been shunned by all 4 Astroin groups, kicking him from their sector, leaving him alone, he's used the hate from those groups to create a robotic army, every night while he did so, he'll sneak into the group sector, and steal blood samples from other Astroins till he had enough to make said army, each robot contains a very small sample of blood, nothing much was given to them due to overheating. Each robot was programmed to kill a specific Astroin, Ion's first design was very weak compared to others due to this one being programmed to kill his adoptive brother, Bilant (who soon becomes Blink). These series of actions has started "The Eptic War"</p></div>
         <div style="background-color: rgb(197, 193, 139); width: 750px;"><p>The Eptic war has ended up all but one of the Astroin life form killed off. Bilant, being the last one, being able to fend off Ion after being forced to watch his parents get killed off in front of him. Ion in a damaged shape was taken back by Sickle, after failing to convince Bilant to work with him, gives Ion an upgrade, yet when Ion was sent to finish his job, He finds no scannings of Bilant. the time that was used to find Bilant, was also time Ion got to use to see exactly what he's caused, yet he doesn't feel anything</p></div>
            <div style="background-color: rgb(197, 193, 139); width: 750px;"><p>Somedays Ion's programming malfunctions, and due to the blood sample of Blink, he gets emotional, in certain cases, sees the day "his parents" die constantly, this is always stopped by a soft reboot.</p>
