        <div id="blink" style="width:550px; background-color: hsla(44, 47%, 50%, 0.445);"><P>Adoptive brother of Sickle, Blink has weirdly been able to surpass everything I throw at him. Blink is a Astroin, specifically of the demon variant, with that knowledge, they are reality benders, and considered to be "The Astroins of the stars", these type of Astroins are very technical due to their weird yet powerful abilities, stemming from simple stars that allows them to warp from different parts from the world, other dimensions and multiverses, to being able to change reality and whatever they can obtain, to their own wants and desires. This Demon Astroin seems to be more selfless than the others before the Eptic war, yet I sadly have no other choice but to <b>Kill Him</b></P></div>

Pink is a shapeshifter due to her nature, born a slime and abandoned by her family, and was picked up by the king of the land down below, eventually she became the Princess of hell, and became a chief of her own group of hell hounds and imps, protecting them at whatever cause, after a while she went to earth to explore more on who she was, and met Blink, where they eventually got together, If she's dead, then i can make it easier to kill him off..</p></div>
