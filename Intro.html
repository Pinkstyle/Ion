Ion is a kind of robot called Eptics, which are assassin robots, which need the blood of their target to operate, this blood is used as their DNA, so anything that happened, or happens to the host of their blood, goes to their memory, even death, after the target is dealt with, they can self destruct, or live "as their target" having the delusion that they're them.</p></div><br>
